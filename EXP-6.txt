Aim: Perform data preprocessing task and demonstrate Classification, Clustering, Association 
algorithm on data sets using data mining tool(WEKA / R tool) 

Softwares used: WEKA 

Theory: 
Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (Weka) is a popular suite of machine learning 
software written in Java, developed at the University of Waikato, New Zealand. It is free software 
licensed under the GNU General Public License. 
Weka is a workbench that contains a collection of visualization tools and algorithms for data 
analysis and predictive modeling, together with graphical user interfaces for easy access to these 
functions. 
This original version was primarily designed as a tool for analyzing data from agricultural domains, 
but the more recent fully Java-based version (Weka 3), for which development started in 1997, is 
now used in many different application areas, in particular for educational purposes and research. 

Advantages of Weka include: 
• Free availability under the GNU General Public License. Portability, since it is fully 
implemented in the Java programming language and thus runs on almost any modern 
computing platform. 
• A comprehensive collection of data preprocessing and modeling techniques. 
• Ease of use due to its graphical user interfaces.

CONCLUSION: 
 
The different mining algorithms of data mining were studied and the need for association mining 
algorithm was recognized and understood. Thus, we perform data Pre-processing task and Demonstrate 
performing Classification, Clustering, Association algorithm on data sets using data mining using 
WEKA tool
