The Page Rank Algorithm

Set PR ← [r₁, r₂, ... , rN], where r₁ is some initial rank of page I, and N the number of Web pages in the graph;
d ← 0.15; D ← [1/N ... 1/N]^T;
A is the adjacency matrix as described above;

do
PRᵢ₊₁ ← Aᵀ * PRᵢ;
PRᵢ₊₁ ← (1 - d) * PRᵢ₊₁ + d * D;
δ ← || PRᵢ₊₁ - PRᵢ ||₁

While δ < ε, where ε is a small number indicating the convergence threshold.

return PR.


Theory:

PageRank (PR) is an algorithm used by Google Search to rank websites in their search engine results. 
PageRank was named after Larry Page, one of the founders of Google. PageRank is a way of measuring 
the importance of website pages. According to Google:

PageRank works by counting the number and quality of links to a page to determine a rough estimate 
of how important the website is. The underlying assumption is that more important websites are likely 
to receive more links from other websites.

It is not the only algorithm used by Google to order search engine results, 
but it is the first algorithm that was used by the company, and it is the best-known.
The above centrality measure is not implemented for multi-graphs.
