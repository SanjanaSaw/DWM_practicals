Aim: To implement OLAP operations: Slice, Dice, Roll up, Drill down, and Pivot based on experiment 1 case 
study. 

Theory: 

3.1 Roll up (drill-up): 
ROLLUP is used in tasks involving subtotals. It creates subtotals at any level of aggregation needed, from the most 
detailed up to a grand total i.e., climbing up a concept hierarchy for the dimension such as time or geography. Example: 
A Query could involve a ROLLUP of year>month>day or country>state>city. 
Input & Output 
Explanation: 
The SQL query calculates total sales for each store in an ice cream parlor, using the ROLLUP function to create summary 
levels. It joins sales data with store information and groups the results by store ID to provide a hierarchical view of 
total sales 
. 

3.2Drill down (Roll down): 
This is a reverse of the ROLL UP operation discussed above. The data is aggregated from a higher-level 
summary to a lower-level summary/detailed data. 
Input & Output 
Explanation: 
The SQL query calculates total sales for each product in each store, joining sales data with product and store 
information. It groups the results by store ID and product ID to provide a detailed view of sales performance. 

3.3  Slicing  
A slice in a multidimensional array is a column of data corresponding to a single value for one or more 
members of the dimension. It helps the user to visualize and gather the information specific to a 
dimension. 
Input & Output 
Explanation: 
The SQL query calculates the total sales for product 1 in store 1. It joins sales data with product information, filters 
for store 1, groups by product ID, and orders the result. 

3.4 Dicing: 
Dicing is similar to slicing, but it works a little bit differently. When one thinks of slicing, filtering is 
done to focus on a particular attribute. Dicing, on the other hand, is more of a zoom feature that selects 
a subset over all the dimensions, but for specific values of the dimension. 
Input & Output 
Explanation: 
The SQL query calculates the total sales for products 1 and 2 in store 1. It joins sales data with product information, 
filters for store 1 and specific product IDs, groups by product ID, and orders the result. 

3.5 Pivot 
Pivot otherwise known as Rotate changes the dimensional orientation of the cube, i.e. rotates the data axes to view 
the data from different perspectives. Pivot groups data with different dimensions. The below cubes show 2D 
representation of Pivot. 
Input & Output 
Explanation: 
The SQL query calculates the total sales of products 1, 2, and 3 for each store. It joins sales data with store 
information, uses conditional expressions to sum the sales amounts for each product, groups by store ID, and orders 
the result 


CONCLUSION: 
From this practical, I learned how to apply OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) operations such as Slice, Dice, roll 
up, Drill down, and Pivot to analyse and manipulate data efficiently. These operations are valuable tools for gaining 
insights from complex datasets, as demonstrated in our experiment with online transaction data. They allow for 
dynamic exploration and summarization of data, enabling better decision-making and a deeper understanding of 
spending behaviours and financial patterns.
